# ⚙️ Java Module 2 – Operators and Control Statements

This repository contains simple, concept-based **Java programs** demonstrating how different **operators** and **control statements** work in Java.  
Each program uses **user input** and provides clear console output examples for better understanding.

## 🧩 Program Details

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
**Description:** Performs arithmetic operations on two integers.

Enter two integers: 20 6
Sum = 26
Difference = 14
Product = 120
Quotient = 3
Remainder = 2


---

### 2️⃣ Bitwise Operators
**Description:** Demonstrates bitwise **AND**, **OR**, and **XOR** on user-entered integers.

Enter two integers: 5 3
a & b = 1
a | b = 7
a ^ b = 6


---

### 3️⃣ Relational Operators
**Description:** Compares two numbers and prints which is greater or if they are equal.


Enter two numbers: 10 20
20 is greater than 10



---

### 4️⃣ Logical Operators
**Description:** Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on **age** and **citizenship**.

Enter your age: 20
Are you a citizen? (true/false): true
Eligible to vote.



---

### 5️⃣ Assignment Operators
**Description:** Demonstrates the use of `+=`, `-=`, and `*=` operators.


Enter an integer: 10
After += : 15
After -= : 13
After *= : 39


---

### 6️⃣ Conditional (Ternary) Operator
**Description:** Uses the **ternary operator** to determine if a number is even or odd.


Enter a number: 7
7 is Odd


---

### 7️⃣ Selection Statements (if–else)
**Description:** Determines whether the number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.


Enter a number: -5
Negative



---

### 8️⃣ Iteration Statements (for loop)
**Description:** Prints the **multiplication table** for any user-entered number.


Enter a number: 4
Multiplication Table of 4:
4 x 1 = 4
4 x 2 = 8
...
4 x 10 = 40




---

### 9️⃣ Jump Statements (continue)
**Description:** Prints numbers 1–10 but skips the number 5 using the **continue** statement.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Programs

1. Save each code in a separate `.java` file with the same class name.  
2. Open a terminal in the folder location.  
3. Compile the program using:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
